Template: shared/news/organization
Type: string
Default: --none--
_Description: Name of your organization:
 You don't seem to have an /etc/news/organization file. Usually that
 contains the name of your organization as you want it to appear on the
 Organization line of outgoing articles/mail/patches. Please supply the
 name of your organization as you want it to appear on the Organization
 line of outgoing articles/patches.  (It is nice if this also specifies
 your location.  Your city name is probably sufficient if well known.) For
 example:
 .
    University of Southern North Dakota, Hoople
 .
 Type in "--none--" if you do not want to specify one.
