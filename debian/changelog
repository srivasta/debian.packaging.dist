  * [cfb9a7d]: [topic--man-fixes]: Fix man page comment schema The
    commenting scheme used in the man pages was three consecutive single
    quotes (`'''') at the beginning of a line. his works, but `gtroff'
    gives a warning about an undefined macro (namely `'''), which is
    harmless, but irritating. To avoid this, this commit changes the
    schema to start the line with `.\"' which causes the line to be
    treated as an undefined request and thus ignored completely.

  * New upstream release.
     - Append $ccflags so that it can override the defaults assuming the compiler
       picks the last choice as GCC does.
     - Use the preprocessor output to detect the GCC version instead of executing
       the compiled binary which is unsuitable for cross-compiling.
     - Make sure Instruct depends on Begin to move Begin ahead of any
       question asked by Configure.
     - Panic if a routine is defined more than once.

  * If a script uses a temp file which is created in /tmp, then an
    attacker can create symlink with the same name in this directory in
    order to destroy or rewrite some system or user files.  Symlink attack
    may also lead not only to the data desctruction but to denial of
    service as well. Creating files with rand or pid to randomize the file
    names is not adequate to protect the system. We now use File::Temp to
    safely create the temporary files as needed. This closes a grave bug.
    There are no code changes in this version, apart from the bug fix.
                                                        Closes: #496412

  * New upstream release
    - SVN revision number is now automatically generated in "revision.h".
      The old patchlevel information is no longer used, and <PATCHLEVEL>
      is deprecated in unit files, replaced by <REVISION>.
    - Added automatic SVN revision computation in "revision.h".
    - Removed last instance of $*, no longer supported in Perl 5.10.
    - Perl 5.10 no longer supports "$*" anywhere... even in the initial
      exec line meant to be parsed by the shell...
    - Reset CDPATH to avoid pdksh's emission of the chosen dir on "cd".
    - Applied diff from H.Merijn Brand to keep it working with perl 5.10,
      which no longer supports the old $* perl4 variable to request
      multiline matching.
    - Linux does not like ^M as line endings: cpp 4.1.x complains.  Try
      with ^A, hoping it will continue to work on HP-UX.
    - Added InstallProgramNoStrip() to request installation of a program
      without  stripping the debugging symbols.
    - Applied patch from Christian Biere, which adds "-Wshadow" to gcc 3.x
      flags.
    - Taught metaxref to use MANIFEST if MANIFEST.new is missing.
    - Added I_SYS_POLL and I_POLL since we cannot rely on HAS_POLL being
      enough  to include <poll.h>.
    - Do not list special unit "Mcc" as being made.
    - Removed stale Mcc dependency.
    - Default to "-O2 -g" when using gcc.
    - This starts the dist-3.5 baseline.
    -  Regenerated all Makefile.SH files.
    - Removed obsoleted ">VAR" lines requesting that the symbol be
      included. Jmake from 3.5 is now smart enough to figure this out by
      itself.
    - Added keyword expansion.
    - InstallTarget() now uses :: targets.
      Default empty rule for all makefiles is now called "all" instead of
     "emptyrule" because if there is nothing to be done, GNU make prints
      the target name and "emptyrule" is not pretty.
    - Advertise SVN's repository for dist in every generated Configure
      script.
    - Fixed Jmakefile: there's no need to request manual inclusion of
      symbols. The MakeDirectories() target was using @! instead of proper
      @@ terminator to introduce the commands.
    - Let metaconfig use the MANIFEST file if there is no MANIFEST.new.
      The MANIFEST.new file is necessary when using the "pat" tools, but
      not when running metaconfig by itself.
    - Added keyword substitution property.
    - Updated copyright date.
  * Recorded the VCS repository location for this package (newly moved to
    a public git repo)
  * Move to the new, make -j friendly targets in debian/rules.

Old Changelog:

dist (3.60-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added the architecture field to the package file name.
  * point to /usr/doc/copright/Artistic rather than install
    our own copy.
  * Fixed a problem with the nis.U unit which left the symbols
    hostcat, groupcat, and passcat empty if it did not detect
    yellow pages on the system.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>

dist (3.60-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * moved the man page for dist from section 1 to section 7,
    which is more suitable anyway since dist is not an executable
    but a meta name. This fixes Bug#2661.
  * edited manpages to refer to dist.7 rather than dist.1

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>

dist (3.60-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added architecture header in control
  * added section header
  * merged the package revision header into the revision header.
  * cleaned up the debian.rules.
  * added the Changelog.
  * Fixed the description field not to include multiple contiguous
    spaces

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>

dist (3.60-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use /etc/news/organization instead of /etc/organization
    Please note that people who installed mailagent-3.44-1
    and/or dist-3.60-2 shall have to remove /etc/organization
    manually after upgrading both packages.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>
