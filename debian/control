Description: Tools for developing, maintaining and distributing software
 The dist package is a set of tools meant to ease the construction
 and maintenance of portable software.
 .
 The first component is the Configure script generator, metaconfig, which
 automatically builds the Configure script from your sources. Ideally,
 the end-user receiving your source code will simply have to read
 your README file, run the Configure script (which is self-documented),
 and then run make.
 .
 The second component is the Makefile.SH generator, which is a generic
 configured Makefile, reusing some of the information figured out
 by Configure, and a generic Jmakefile description.
 .
 The third component is the RCS aware package generator, which is
 used when it's time to build up the shell archives used to distribute
 your program.
 .
 The fourth and latest component is the patch generator, used to
 make updates of your sources, which can later be applied on the
 original  distribution by using the patch program.
